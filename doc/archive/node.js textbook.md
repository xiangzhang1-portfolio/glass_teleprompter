# node.js textbook

[Just read this][1]

Pretty much `node node.js` just like `gcc a.c`. Very silent.

DO NOT USE OFFICIAL INSTALLER.
Use homebrew instead. 
Fuck the uninstall process.

## noble (bluetooth)

brew install node@8

OLD VERSION ONLY. whatever FUCK you.

`Noble` does not support Mojave, since this library relies heavily on `Noble` to manage the BLE handshake, `minidrone` is broken on Mojave.

FUCK ME I guess.
